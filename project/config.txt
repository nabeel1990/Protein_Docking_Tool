# 'Process' parameter is used only with the 'pdt' executable. 'pdt' unifies all protein docking subprocesses into a single executable file, allowing to run predocking, docking and conversion of coefs to a rasterized 3D grid (for visualization and debugging purposes). 'Process' can be equal to: predocking, docking and coef2grid . If predocking or docking are run as standalone executables, this parameter will be overlooked. Several values can be listed for the 'process' parameter in order to run them in a row, example:
#process: predocking coef2grid docking
process: predocking coef2grid
